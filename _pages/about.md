I’m a lecturer (equivalent to an assistant professor in the US) at the University of Western Australia. Prior to that, I was a tenured Research Scientist at Data61, CSIRO. I am a Senior Member of IEEE and currently serve as an Associate Editor in ***IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security*** (Oct 2024-present) and ***IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems*** (Jan 2024—present). I received the Outstanding PC Member Award of ASIACCS 2024.

My current research interests are AI Security and Privacy, System Security, and Hardware Security (i.e., Physical Unclonable Functions). I received  my  M.Sc  degree  from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2013 and a Ph.D degree from the University of Adelaide, Australia, in 2017.
